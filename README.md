# Logo Generator
by Jake Smith

## Project Description
This is a command-line application that accepts user input in order to generate a simple logo out of shapes and letters. When the user enters 'node index' into the terminal, they are
asked a serious of questions to define what they want their logo to look like, and then after that, a svg file is created that contains the information to reproduce the created file.
This application heavily utilizes the inquirer and jest node modules, as well as fs to write new files from JavaScript input.
